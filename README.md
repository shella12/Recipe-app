<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Recipe-app] <a name="about-project"></a>

With the **Recipe app**, you can organize and manage your cooking with ease. You can save and track your ingredients, inventory, and recipes in one place. You can also generate a shopping list based on what you need for a recipe or what you have in stock. And if you love to share your recipes with others, you can make them public and let anyone enjoy them.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby (ruby --version)
- SQLite3 (sqlite3 --version)
- Node.js (node --version)
- Yarn (yarn --version)

### Install

Since Rails started out as a project full of packages and libraries, and has since become the full-stack framework it is, it can be easy to forget that it is also just a package itself.
If these are all good, you can check:

- Rails (rails --version)

If you get a good version, you're ready to go! (Almost).
If you didn't, you may still need to install the Rails gem.

`gem install rails`

It can be good to keep in mind which version you're using as each of these will update on their own schedule and sometimes the code changes just enough to give us bugs. This will be true for all the packages, gems, APIs, or any other dependencies you may bring into your projects as a developer.


### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone git@github.com:shella12/Recipe-app.git
```

### Run

To run this app on your local environment you need to run `bundle install`

### Usage

You need to get your Rails application server running,in order to see your app in the browser. This is like live preview in the browser for rails applications. Run :


```sh
 $ bin/rails server

```

OR

```sh
$ rails s

```

visit [localhost](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser!

To exit server enter “Control (^ )+ C”

### Tests

To create tests, RSpec testing framework is used. In order to run tests use following command:


```sh
 $ rspec spec

```
_Note: You can also run the test by using just `rspec` but it runs all tests folders and files with name like `****_spec`_
